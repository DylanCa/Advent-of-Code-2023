# Learning Rust through Advent of Code 2023
This repo is **not** aimed to be Production-ready at all, but rather to learn the basis and fundamentals of Rust while having fun doing [Advent of Code 2023](https://adventofcode.com/).

### What you can/can't expect in this repo:
| Can                              | Can't                            |
|----------------------------------|----------------------------------|
| Correct Advent of Code Answers   | Not the best method to get them  |
| Rust code                        | Albeit a rusty one               |
| Goodwill to learn a new language | Full of mistakes and bad manners |
